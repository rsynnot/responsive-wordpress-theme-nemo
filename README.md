Responsive Wordpress Theme 'Nemo' 

This is a theme that Im currently developing for my portfolio.

It's a responsive theme where I'll trial various responsive methods over time, so it's a work in progress.

After seeking Eddie Machado's permission (he is the original author of the Bones theme framework on which this is built), I am happy to share this theme with the dev community.

If you have any comments, suggestions, or feedback, please feel free to email me, or comment here on the project.
